# P3-3D-Intro
First 2 parts of the 3D FPS Godot Tutorial
By John Xiao

# Project Report #
First opening up the provided files left me a little overwhelmed, there was just so much from the start. Thankfully it wasn't as bad as it looked, but I did still run into a strange issue. Initally I wasn't able to get the weapon changing to work, that is, it wouldn't register the button presses. I'm still not entirely sure as to what the problem was, but I reverted some of my initial edits for the animation names on the chance that there was an issue there and fixed a typo in the AnimationPlayerManager - one of these fixed the issue. I wasn't able to fully refactor the code to make it fall in line with our adopted style guide, mainly because there were portions of it where I wasn't sure as to how I could edit them. Despite my attempt to make some headway in regards to it, I don't believe that I have fully fulfilled the requirement of refactoring the solution. It was a fairly enjoyable experience working on a 3D project.

# Self-Evaluation #
- [x] D-1: The repository link is submitted before the project deadline.
- [x] D-2: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file that includes the project identifier and author's name.
- [x] C-1: The tutorial has been completed, with at least one commit for each of the two parts.
- [ ] B-1: Earn one star.
- [ ] A-1: Earn two stars.
- [ ] ⭐ Refactor your solution to follow <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/">our adopted style guide</a>
- [ ] ⭐ Refactor the scripts from Part 2 of the tutorial to enforce the <abbr title="object-oriented">OO</abbr> principle of encapsulation. Explain your refactoring in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [ ] ⭐ Refactor the weapon management code to eliminate some of the redundancy. Explain your refactoring in the <code>README.md</code> file.
